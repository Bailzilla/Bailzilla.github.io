			<h2>Testimonials</h2>	
			<p><strong>Firlian M - Former Student</strong><br>
				"Keith was a great support back then when I was at Bunker Hill Community College as there were some, confusing and complicated 
				math problems and equations to solve. Keith took the time to help me understand more the concept and formula for those problems 
				and the techniques and rationale to use when confronted with complex math projects.
				He was always calm, understanding, helpful and most importantly, he always made sure I had it 100% before letting me go.
				Keith has a lot of passion to teach and help and a lot of dedication. 
				Thanks to him I was able to  batter perform in class and I am very grateful for his support."<br>

				<strong>Mike M - Current Teacher and Former Co-worker</strong><br>
				"Keith is ideal for online tutoring! This website is dedicated to mastery across ANY medium 
				of study. As a lifelong educator, I struggle to find a better online academic support resource."
