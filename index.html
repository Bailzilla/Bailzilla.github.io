		<h2>About Me</h2>	
		<p>I have been a lifelong learner, as well as athlete. I played 3 sports in high school and was a state champion as a sprinter. 
			After graduating high school, I went on to attend The University of Pennsylvania. While also playing varsity football, 
			I was able to earn a degree in Economics from The Wharton School of Business. After graduating college, I spent a year in Boston working
			as a tutor at Bunker Hill Community College. I have worked with students across all ages and backgrounds. I am dedicated
			to helping you succeed! If you need help with a tutor, <a href="mailto:Bailey.Keith.Allen@gmail.com"><strong>reach out</strong></a> and let's come up with a plan together .
