			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this.</p>
			<p>We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. And right there you got an almighty cloud. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p>	
			<p>Working it up and down, back and forth. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. All kinds of happy little splashes. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.</p>
			<p>I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. It's important to me that you're happy. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.</p>

			<h2>Make Yourself at Home</h2>
			<p><strong>Sit Back: </strong>It is a lot of fun. Just let these leaves jump off the brush When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.</p>
			<p><strong>Relax: </strong>Poor old tree. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. There comes a nice little fluffer. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.</p>
			<p><strong>Stay A While: </strong>You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. With practice comes confidence. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world.</p>
