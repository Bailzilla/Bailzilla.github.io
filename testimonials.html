    <p><strong>Firlian M - Former Student</strong><br>
        "Keith was a great support back then when I was at Bunker Hill Community College as there were some, confusing and complicated 
        math problems and equations to solve. Keith took the time to help me understand more the concept and formula for those problems 
        and the techniques and rationale to use when confronted with complex math projects.
        He was always calm, understanding, helpful and most importantly, he always made sure I had it 100% before letting me go.
        Keith has a lot of passion to teach and help and a lot of dedication. 
        Thanks to him I was able to  batter perform in class and I am very grateful for his support."<br>
